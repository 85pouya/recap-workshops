Q: What is a javascript REPL? Can you name two ways to open one?

A: {YOUR ANSWER HERE}

A Read-Eval-Print Loop, or REPL, is a computer environment where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then the results are returned to the user. REPLs provide an interactive environment to explore tools available in specific environments or programming languages. Some examples include the Node.

1. If you have node installed, then you also have the Node.js REPL. To start it, simply enter node in your command line shell. The > symbol lets you know that you can enter JavaScript code to be immediately evaluated. When you press ENTER, the REPL will evaluate the expression.
2. When writing Node.js code, itâ€™s common to print messages via the global console.log method or a similar function.
