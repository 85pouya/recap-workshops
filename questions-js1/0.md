Q: What is a javascript REPL? Can you name two ways to open one?

A: {YOUR ANSWER HERE}

A Read-Eval-Print Loop, or REPL, is a computer environment where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then the results are returned to the user. REPLs provide an interactive environment to explore tools available in specific environments or programming languages. Some examples include the Node.

Ctrl-A on a blank line will enter raw REPL mode. This is like a permanent paste mode, except that characters are not echoed back. Ctrl-B on a blank like goes to normal REPL mode. Ctrl-C cancels any input, or interrupts the currently running code.

Remember to commit and push when you're finished!
